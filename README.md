# ðŸ§® Faulty Calculator

This is a fun JavaScript project where a calculator works normally â€” except 10% of the time, it gives a wrong answer based on faulty logic.

### ðŸ”§ Faulty Mappings:
- `+` becomes `-`
- `-` becomes `/`
- `*` becomes `+`
- `/` becomes `**`

### âœ… Technologies
- JavaScript (no HTML/CSS needed)

### ðŸ’¡ Purpose
This project was built while learning functions, conditionals, and randomness in JavaScript. A fun way to explore logic errors intentionally!
